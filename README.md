# Time_Series_Project

We analyse a time series of employment in various industries in Wisconsin from January 1961 to October 1975. The dataset consists of 178 monthly observations expressed in units of 1000 employees. It can be found in the tsdl R package (5).

After performing an initial data analysis, we fit two classes of models to the data:
  - SARIMA models
  - Generalized additive models

Finally, each model is used to forecast the next two years of employment num- bers.
